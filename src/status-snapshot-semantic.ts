/// Bump when the menubar payload's rendering semantics change without a
/// package release or daily-cache version change. The envelope version in
/// session-cache protects record shape; this protects the meaning of an
/// otherwise valid one. Each revision must be distinct from every OTHER
/// branch's revision: a snapshot written by a different change must not be
/// accepted here while lacking this change's fields.
/// v5: providerDetails carries per-provider tokens and sessions, which a v4
///     record predates — the dock glance would read a provider as having no
///     token breakdown purely because the snapshot was written before that.
/// v6: sessionCountBasis is now part of payload meaning. A same-package v5
///     snapshot written before that field existed still matches the v5
///     semantic key; omitting it makes empty identity-0 read as undefined-0
///     ("unavailable") and nonempty exact counts as a bound. Daily and session
///     cache versions stay put: retained unknown accounting must remain a
///     partial bound, not be discarded to regain exact labels.
/// v7: providerDetails also carries per-provider cacheReadTokens, which a v6
///     record predates — the dock's cache-read row would stay hidden behind a
///     warm snapshot even once the live payload had the data.
/// v8: lifetime topProjects retains all projects and session details for the
///     widget explorer, including zero-cost threads. Older snapshots cap both.
/// v9: selected-period topProjects also retains all active projects, including
///     zero-cost sessions, so the explorer can filter the lifetime thread tree.
